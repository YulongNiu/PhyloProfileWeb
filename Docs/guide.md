## 1. Input ##

### 1.1 Linkage number ###

The threshold of linkages number for each gene could be randomly chose between `1` and `500`(even a float number like `5.4`). A smaller vaule means a more stringent threshold of predicted linkages.

If you want to get less but more reliable linkages, please try a small value, for example `20`. Please be aware, a small value may be at a risk of missing some potential and novel linkages which do not have very strong evidence.

### 1.2 Plot parameters ###

Please try default plot parameters at first. If you are not satisfied with output figures, please adjust the parameters and run it again.
